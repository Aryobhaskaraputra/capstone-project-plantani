## planTani Project Overview

Indonesia is known as an agrarian country, a country whose economy depends on the agricultural sector. 
As an agricultural country, Indonesia has abundant natural resources and is believed to boost the country's economy, but farmers in Indonesia often face obstacles such as plant diseases. 
Lack of knowledge about caring for plants and weather conditions that are now becoming increasingly erratic. 
This is also essential for someone who wants to grow plants or/and is still a beginner at farming or gardening.
Therefore, this idea comes to create an application that can detect plant diseases and how to handle and care for them along with warnings of the upcoming season. 
With these features, it is expected to make it easier for farmers or people who like to grow their plants to recognize the type of disease in plants as well as how to handle and care accordingly without having to be confused or hesitate anymore.
This application is expected to increase the efficiency of farming, food availability, and food security in Indonesia. 
As an agricultural country with great economic potential, this application is expected to have a positive impact on improving the welfare of the community and the growth of the country. 
In addition, this application can also be an educational tool for the general public to increase their awareness and knowledge about the importance of agriculture, especially in a country like Indonesia, where agriculture plays an important role in the economy. 
The app can also be used as a tool by government agencies to monitor crop health and yields, which can help prevent and protect the agricultural sector from losses.

## Project Scope

+ This application aims to assist farmers and people who are interested in gardening or farming in detecting diseases on their plants quickly and accurately using machine learning technology.
+ The app will be operated on Android devices.
+ The app allows users to take photos of plants suspected of having a disease.
+ The application will process the captured image and provide a diagnosis of the type of disease that may attack the plant.
+ The app will provide complete information on the type of disease detected, including symptoms, treatment, and preventive measures.
+ The machine learning team will create a machine learning model to classify diseases in plants, as the main feature, using the TensorFlow Library to design a Neural Network (deep learning) using the dataset from the collected results
+ The cloud computing team will provide cloud services to deploy applications and create image storage by using cloud storage to store images and other data needed.
+ The mobile development team will create a UI design for the application and implement it into Android Studio using the Kotlin programming language.
