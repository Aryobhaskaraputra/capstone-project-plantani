# PlanTani Mobile App
The Mobile Development team creates Mobile Application that can detects plant disease. The app is built with Kotlin Programming Language and some of good libraries.

## What do we use?
### 1. CameraX
With CameraX from Android Jetpack, we can provide camera plugin into our application without relying built-in phone camera app. In addition, it has more features.

### 2. Android Architecture Component (ViewModel and LiveData)
We use ViewModel and LiveData to provide better data handling from Model, and show them into the app.

### 3. Kotlin Coroutines
It can do asynchronous task better, such as consuming API.

### 4. MVVM Architecture with Dependency Injection Pattern
By using MVVM, it can separate business logics like login and register, and better for retriving data. Also, we use dependency injection pattern to easily maintain program code
